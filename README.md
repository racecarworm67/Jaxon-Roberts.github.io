## Mathematics & Computer Science Student. Technical Systems Designer.

I use high-level player intuition, mathematical modeling, and Java to deconstruct and design the game systems behind competitive integrity.

### About Me
I'm a Math & CS student with thousands of hours of competitive gaming experience (Grandmaster *Overwatch*, Diamond *League of Legends*). I'm passionate about *why* games are balanced, not just *that* they are. I build tools and prototypes to test my design ideas and find elegant solutions to complex system problems.
